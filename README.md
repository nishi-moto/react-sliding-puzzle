# React Sliding Puzzle

Another [Sliding Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle), but made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and dynamic!


## `Features`

    - Numbered blocks
    - Responsiveness
    - Counter tracking the amount of moves
    - Win condition
    - Dynamic number of blocks; with width and height input, allowing any dymension



## `To do`

### Support image tiles
#### Random image:
Get image from an API and crop it.
#### Uploaded image:
Get a imagem uploaded by the user and crop it.
#### Image URL:
Get an image URL provided by the user and crop it.


### Implement dynamic font size and position for numbers
When there are a big number of tiles in a small screen, the number of tyles break. Would be nice to have a dynamic font size and positioning to solve this.


### Implement a more interesting win dialog
For now, just a alert with a message appears, which is not the best. So, would be good to have a nice dialog box with the message and a automatic reshuffle of the board.
